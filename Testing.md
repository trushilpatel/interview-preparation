## 1. What is Software Testing?

**Software Testing** is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The main objective is to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements in contrast to the actual requirements.

---

<a name="2"></a>
## 2. Importance of Software Testing

- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures the product meets customer expectations.
- **Cost Reduction:** Detecting defects early reduces the cost of fixing them.
- **Security:** Identifies vulnerabilities to prevent security breaches.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Enhances user experience, leading to customer loyalty.

**Real-World Example:**

In 2014, a software glitch caused a major U.S. airline to ground its flights, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage. Proper testing could have prevented this incident.

<a name="3"></a>
## 3. Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

The **Software Testing Life Cycle** is a sequence of specific activities conducted during the testing process to ensure software quality goals are met.

**Phases of STLC:**

1. **Requirement Analysis**
2. **Test Planning**
3. **Test Case Development**
4. **Environment Setup**
5. **Test Execution**
6. **Test Closure**

**Interview Perspective:**

- **Question:** *Can you explain the Software Testing Life Cycle and its phases?*
- **Answer:** *Yes, the STLC consists of phases like Requirement Analysis, where we understand what needs to be tested; Test Planning, where we plan resources and timelines; Test Case Development, where we write test cases; Environment Setup; Test Execution; and finally, Test Closure.*

## 4. Types of Software Testing

Software testing can be broadly categorized into **Functional** and **Non-Functional** testing.

<a name="4a"></a>
### 4.1 Functional Testing

Ensures that each function of the software operates in conformance with the requirement specification.

**Types:**

- **Unit Testing**
- **Integration Testing**
- **System Testing**

<a name="5"></a>
## 5. Testing Methodologies

<a name="5a"></a>
### 5.1 Waterfall Model

A linear sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.

**Interview Perspective:**

- **Question:** *What are the drawbacks of the Waterfall model in testing?*
- **Answer:** *It lacks flexibility, making it difficult to accommodate changes. Testing is done after development, which can lead to discovering defects late in the cycle.*

<a name="5b"></a>
### 5.2 V-Model

An extension of the Waterfall model that emphasizes verification and validation.

<a name="5c"></a>
### 5.3 Agile Testing

Testing practices that follow the principles of agile software development.

**Real-World Application:**

Companies like **Spotify** and **Netflix** use Agile methodologies to deliver continuous updates.

<a name="5d"></a>
### 5.4 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

A practice where tests are written before writing the bare minimum of code required for the test to be fulfilled.

**Example:**

In TDD, a developer writes a unit test for a function that does not exist yet, watches it fail, and then implements the function to make the test pass.

<a name="5e"></a>
### 5.5 Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

An extension of TDD that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders.

**Tools:**

- **Cucumber**
- **SpecFlow**
