### 1. ACID Properties

### 1. ACID Properties

ACID is an acronym that ensures reliable processing of database transactions. Here are the properties in detail:

- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all parts of a transaction are completed; if any part fails, the entire transaction fails.  
   _Example_: Transferring money between two bank accounts. If the debit from one account succeeds but the credit to the other fails, the transaction should be rolled back.

- **Consistency**: Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules and constraints.  
   _Example_: If a bank has a rule that total money should not exceed a certain amount, consistency ensures this rule is not violated after transactions.

- **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions occur independently, so that concurrent transactions do not affect each other’s execution.  
   _Example_: If two users are trying to withdraw money from the same account simultaneously, isolation ensures that one transaction completes before the other starts.

- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will remain so even in the event of a system failure.  
   _Example_: After a successful bank transaction, even if the database crashes, the changes must persist when the system is restored.

### 2. Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The common normal forms include:

- **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Ensures that all attributes are atomic (indivisible) and each record is unique.  
   _Example_: In a student database, a table containing student names and their courses should separate courses into different rows rather than listing them together.

- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Achieved when 1NF is satisfied and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.  
   _Example_: In a student-course database, if student ID is the primary key, course name should depend only on student ID, not on the student’s name.

- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Achieved when 2NF is satisfied, and all the attributes are only dependent on the primary key. No transitive dependency exists.  
   _Example_: A table with student ID, student name, and advisor ID should separate advisor details into a different table to prevent dependency on non-key attributes.

- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: A stronger version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.  
   _Example_: If a student can have multiple advisors and an advisor can supervise multiple students, this should be split into separate tables.

- **Denormalization**: The process of combining tables to improve read performance at the expense of write performance.  
   _Example_: In a reporting database, a normalized schema might be denormalized to combine related tables for faster querying.

### 3. SQL vs NoSQL

- **SQL (Relational Database)**: Uses structured query language (SQL) and is based on a fixed schema. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.  
   _Use Case_: Best suited for applications requiring complex queries, transaction management, and structured data (e.g., banking systems).

- **NoSQL (Non-Relational Database)**: Offers flexible schemas and is designed to handle unstructured data. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.  
   _Use Case_: Ideal for applications with large volumes of data, rapid development, and scalability needs (e.g., social media platforms, IoT applications).

### 4. Database Indexing

Indexing improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional storage space and write performance.

- **B-Tree Indexes**: Balanced tree structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.  
   _Pros_: Efficient for range queries.  
   _Cons_: More complex to implement.

- **Hash Indexes**: Uses a hash table where data is stored as key-value pairs.  
   _Pros_: Extremely fast for equality comparisons.  
   _Cons_: Poor performance on range queries.

- **Use Case**: For a search feature in a large e-commerce application, B-Tree indexes can help retrieve products efficiently based on price ranges.

### 5. Joins

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.

- **Inner Join**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.  
   _Example_: Retrieving all students who are enrolled in courses.

- **Outer Join**: Includes rows that do not have a match in one of the tables.

  - **Left Join**: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right.
  - **Right Join**: Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left.  
     _Example_: Getting a list of all students and their courses, including those not enrolled in any courses.

- **Cross Join**: Returns the Cartesian product of two tables.  
   _Example_: Pairing each student with every possible course.

- **Self Join**: Joins a table with itself.  
   _Example_: A table of employees where each employee has a manager, allowing retrieval of employee-manager pairs.

### 6. Transactions

Transactions are sequences of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.

- **Commit**: Saves all changes made during the transaction.  
   _Example_: Finalizing a money transfer between accounts.

- **Rollback**: Reverts the database to its previous state in case of an error.  
   _Example_: If a transaction fails due to insufficient funds, a rollback will prevent any changes from being applied.

- **Savepoint**: Allows setting a point within a transaction to which you can roll back.  
   _Example_: In a multi-step process, you can roll back to a savepoint if an error occurs later in the transaction.

### 7. Constraints

Constraints are rules applied to the data in tables to ensure accuracy and integrity.

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.  
   _Example_: Student ID in a student table.

- **Foreign Key**: Creates a link between two tables, enforcing referential integrity.  
   _Example_: A course table where each course references a department ID.

- **Unique Constraint**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.  
   _Example_: Email addresses in a user registration table.

- **Check Constraint**: Ensures all values in a column meet a specific condition.  
   _Example_: Age should be greater than or equal to 18 in a user table.

### 8. Views

A view is a virtual table created by a query that selects data from one or more tables.

- **How to create and use views**:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW active_students AS
  SELECT student_id, name FROM students WHERE active = true;
  ```
  _Use Case_: Simplifies complex queries and provides a layer of security by restricting access to specific data.

### 9. Stored Procedures, Functions, and Triggers

- **Stored Procedures**: A set of SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed as a single call.  
   _Use Case_: Automating repetitive tasks like monthly reports.

- **Functions**: Similar to stored procedures, but can return a value.  
   _Example_: A function to calculate the total sales for a given month.

- **Triggers**: Automatically execute a specified action in response to certain events on a particular table.  
   _Example_: A trigger that automatically updates a last modified timestamp column whenever a record is updated.

### 10. Basic Queries

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
  ```

  _Use Case_: Fetching employee names from a specific department.

- **INSERT**: Adds new records to a table.

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department_id) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 10);
  ```

  _Use Case_: Adding a new employee to the database.

- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records.

  ```sql
  UPDATE employees SET department_id = 20 WHERE employee_id = 5;
  ```

  _Use Case_: Changing an employee's department.

- **DELETE**: Removes records from a table.
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 5;
  ```
  _Use Case_: Removing an employee from the database.

### 11. Advanced Queries

- **Subqueries**: A query nested within another query.  
   _Example_:

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
  WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
  ```

  _Use Case_: Finding employees who work in the Sales department.

- **Correlated Subqueries**: A subquery that references columns from the outer query.  
   _Example_:

  ```sql
  SELECT e1.first_name, e1.salary
  FROM employees e1
  WHERE e1.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id);
  ```

  _Use Case_: Retrieving employees who earn more than the average salary in their department.

- **Common Table Expressions (CTE)**: Temporary result set defined within the execution scope of a single SQL statement.  
   _Example_:
  ```sql
  WITH EmployeeCTE AS (
          SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id
          FROM employees
  )
  SELECT * FROM EmployeeCTE WHERE department_id = 10;
  ```
  _Use Case_: Simplifying complex queries by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts.

### 12. Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **COUNT**: Returns the number of rows.

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
  ```

- **SUM**: Returns the total of a numeric column.

  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
  ```

- **AVG**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.

  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
  ```

- **MIN**: Returns the smallest value.

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
  ```

- **MAX**: Returns the largest value.
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
  ```

### 13. GROUP BY and HAVING

- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows sharing a property so aggregate functions can be applied to each group.  
   _Example_:

  ```sql
  SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id;
  ```

  _Use Case_: Counting the number of employees in each department.

- **HAVING**: Filters records after the `GROUP BY` operation.  
   _Example_:
  ```sql
  SELECT department_id, AVG(salary)
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id
  HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
  ```
  _Use Case_: Retrieving departments with an average salary exceeding $50,000.

### 14. Window Functions

Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.

- **ROW_NUMBER()**: Assigns a unique number to each row in the result set.

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
  FROM employees;
  ```

- **RANK()**: Similar to `ROW_NUMBER()`, but assigns the same rank to ties.

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
  FROM employees;
  ```

- **PARTITION BY**: Divides the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied.

  ```sql
  SELECT department_id, first_name, salary,
               RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
  FROM employees;
  ```

- **OVER()**: Defines the window over which the function operates.  
   _Use Case_: Useful for analytics and reporting, such as ranking employees by salary within each department.

### 15. Union and Union All

- **UNION**: Combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements, removing duplicates.

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name FROM employees
  UNION
  SELECT first_name FROM managers;
  ```

  _Use Case_: Retrieving unique names from multiple tables.

- **UNION ALL**: Combines results while including duplicates.

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name FROM employees
  UNION ALL
  SELECT first_name FROM managers;
  ```

  _Use Case_: When you want to include all entries, including duplicates.

### 16. Query Optimization

Optimizing SQL queries is crucial for improving performance. Here are some tips:

- **Understanding Execution Plans**: Use tools like `EXPLAIN` in PostgreSQL or MySQL to analyze how a query is executed, which can help identify bottlenecks.

  ```sql
  EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
  ```

- **Avoiding Full Table Scans**: Ensure queries use indexes and avoid operations that require scanning the entire table (like using `SELECT *` indiscriminately).

- **Using Indexes Properly**: Create indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval. However, be mindful of the trade-off with insert/update operations.

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_department ON employees(department_id);
  ```

### 17. ER Diagrams

**Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams** are visual representations of the entities within a system and their relationships.

#### Key Components:

- **Entities**: Objects or things in the domain that have a distinct existence. Examples include:

  - **Customer**
  - **Order**
  - **Product**

- **Attributes**: Characteristics or properties of entities. For example:

  - A **Customer** entity may have attributes like `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, and `phone_number`.
  - An **Order** entity may include `order_id`, `order_date`, and `total_amount`.

- **Relationships**: Associations between entities. They can be classified as:
  - **One-to-One**: Each entity in A is related to one entity in B.
    - _Example_: A person has one passport.
  - **One-to-Many**: One entity in A is related to multiple entities in B.
    - _Example_: A customer can place many orders.
  - **Many-to-Many**: Multiple entities in A are related to multiple entities in B.
    - _Example_: Students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

#### Example ER Diagram:

```
[Customer] 1 ------- N [Order]
             |                    |
             | N              1  |
        [Product] ----------- [Order]
```

### 18. Relational Models

**Relational Models** represent data in a structured format using tables (relations), where each table consists of rows and columns.

#### Designing a Database Schema:

1. **Identify Entities**: Based on the requirements, identify the entities that need to be represented.
2. **Define Attributes**: For each entity, determine the necessary attributes.
3. **Establish Relationships**: Identify how the entities relate to one another.
4. **Create Tables**: Translate entities into tables, and define primary keys (unique identifiers) for each table.

#### Example Schema:

- **Customer Table**:
  | customer_id | name | email | phone_number |
  |-------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
  | 1 | John Doe | john@example.com| 1234567890 |

- **Order Table**:
  | order_id | order_date | total_amount | customer_id |
  |----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
  | 101 | 2024-10-01 | 250.00 | 1 |

- **Product Table**:
  | product_id | product_name | price | stock_quantity |
  |------------|--------------|-------|----------------|
  | 501 | Laptop | 1200 | 50 |

#### Relationships in Tables:

- **Foreign Key**: A foreign key in one table that references the primary key in another table establishes the relationship.
  - In the **Order** table, `customer_id` is a foreign key referencing `customer_id` in the **Customer** table.

### 19. Normalization and Denormalization

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

#### Normalization:

- **Advantages**:

  - Reduces data redundancy.
  - Improves data integrity and consistency.
  - Facilitates easier maintenance and updates.

- **Normal Forms**:
  - **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Ensures that all attributes are atomic (no repeating groups).
  - **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Achieves 1NF and ensures all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
  - **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Achieves 2NF and removes transitive dependencies (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes).
  - **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: A stronger version of 3NF, ensuring that every determinant is a candidate key.

#### When to Apply Normalization:

- Use normalization when designing a new database schema where data integrity is crucial, and redundancy must be minimized.

#### Denormalization:

- **Advantages**:

  - Improves read performance by reducing the number of joins needed in queries.
  - Simplifies complex queries by combining related data.

- **When to Apply**:
  - Denormalization is applied in scenarios where read performance is critical, such as in reporting databases or when handling complex queries that require multiple joins.

#### Example of Normalization and Denormalization:

- **Normalized Structure**:

  - Separate **Customer**, **Order**, and **Product** tables with relationships established through foreign keys.

- **Denormalized Structure**:

  - A single **OrderDetails** table that combines information about the order, customer, and products:

    | order_id | customer_name | product_name | order_date | total_amount |
    | -------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
    | 101      | John Doe      | Laptop       | 2024-10-01 | 250.00       |

  This denormalized structure simplifies queries at the cost of potential redundancy (e.g., customer information may be repeated for every order).

---

### Summary

Understanding ER diagrams, relational models, and the principles of normalization and denormalization is crucial for effective data modeling. These concepts help ensure that your database design is efficient, maintainable, and capable of supporting the application's data requirements. Be prepared to discuss these topics, providing examples from your experience or hypothetical scenarios, during interviews.

---

### 19. Indexing

**Indexing** is a data structure technique that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional space and overhead during data modification operations.

#### Types of Indexes

- **Clustered Index**:

  - The data rows are stored in the same order as the index, meaning there can be only one clustered index per table.
  - **Use Case**: Useful for range queries and sorting.
  - **Example**: A clustered index on a `customer_id` column allows fast retrieval of customer data by their IDs.

- **Non-Clustered Index**:

  - The index contains a pointer to the actual data rows. Multiple non-clustered indexes can exist on a table.
  - **Use Case**: Useful for improving the performance of queries with multiple search criteria.
  - **Example**: A non-clustered index on `email` allows for quick lookups by email without reordering the actual data.

- **Covering Index**:
  - An index that contains all the columns needed to satisfy a query, eliminating the need to access the table.
  - **Use Case**: Greatly improves query performance, especially for SELECT statements.
  - **Example**: If a query retrieves `customer_id` and `name`, an index on both columns will allow the database to fulfill the request without scanning the actual data rows.

#### Creating Effective Indexes

- Identify frequently queried columns, especially those used in WHERE clauses and JOIN conditions.
- Use composite indexes for queries filtering on multiple columns.
- Avoid over-indexing; too many indexes can slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

### 20. Query Optimization Techniques

Optimizing queries ensures that they run efficiently, consuming fewer resources and returning results faster.

#### Using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

- **EXPLAIN**: Provides a query execution plan, detailing how the database will execute a query, including index usage and join methods.
- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE**: Executes the query and provides real execution statistics, showing the actual time taken for each step.

#### Steps for Query Tuning

1. **Analyze Execution Plans**: Look for expensive operations, such as full table scans or nested loops.
2. **Review Index Usage**: Ensure indexes are used efficiently and consider adding or modifying indexes as necessary.
3. **Rewrite Queries**: Refactor queries for better performance, such as using joins instead of subqueries when appropriate.

### 21. Sharding and Partitioning

**Sharding** and **Partitioning** are strategies for horizontal scaling of databases, helping to manage large datasets effectively.

#### Sharding

- Distributes data across multiple databases or servers, with each shard containing a portion of the dataset.
- **Use Case**: When a single database instance cannot handle the load or when dealing with very large datasets.
- **Example**: An e-commerce platform can shard user data by geographical location, placing users from North America in one shard and users from Europe in another.

#### Partitioning

- Divides a single database table into smaller, manageable pieces, known as partitions, which can improve query performance and data management.
- **Types**:
  - **Range Partitioning**: Divides data based on a specified range of values (e.g., date ranges).
  - **List Partitioning**: Divides data based on a specific list of values (e.g., categories).
  - **Hash Partitioning**: Distributes data based on a hash function applied to a key column.
- **Example**: A sales table could be partitioned by year, allowing for efficient queries on recent sales.

### 22. Caching

**Caching** is a technique for temporarily storing copies of frequently accessed data in memory to speed up data retrieval.

#### Using Caches (e.g., Redis)

- **How to Use**:
  - Store the results of frequent database queries in Redis.
  - Set an expiration time for cache entries to ensure data consistency.
- **Example**: For a product catalog, cache product details that are frequently accessed, reducing load on the main database.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Ensure you have a strategy for updating or invalidating cache entries when underlying data changes.

### 23. Connection Pooling

**Connection Pooling** is a method of managing database connections efficiently by reusing active connections rather than establishing new ones for each request.

#### Managing Database Connections

- **HikariCP**: A high-performance JDBC connection pool.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces the overhead of connection establishment.
  - Increases application performance by reusing connections.
- **Configuration**: Tune pool size and timeout settings to balance resource usage and responsiveness.

### 24. Database Locks and Deadlocks

**Database Locks** prevent concurrent transactions from conflicting with each other, while **Deadlocks** occur when two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks.

#### How to Detect and Avoid Deadlocks

- **Detection**: Most modern databases have built-in deadlock detection mechanisms. They typically roll back one of the transactions to resolve the deadlock.
- **Avoidance Strategies**:
  - **Locking Order**: Ensure that transactions acquire locks in a consistent order to prevent circular wait conditions.
  - **Timeouts**: Implement timeouts for transactions so that they can automatically roll back if they wait too long for a lock.
  - **Minimize Lock Duration**: Keep transactions short to reduce the chance of locks conflicting.

---

### Summary

Understanding database performance optimization techniques, such as indexing, query optimization, sharding, caching, connection pooling, and managing locks, is crucial for building efficient and scalable database systems. Be prepared to discuss these concepts and their applications in real-world scenarios during your interviews, demonstrating both your theoretical knowledge and practical experience.

### 25. Transactions and Isolation Levels

**Transactions** are sequences of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. They ensure data integrity and consistency in databases, adhering to the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

#### Isolation Levels

Isolation levels determine how transaction integrity is visible to other transactions. They define the level of visibility of data changes made by one transaction to others. The four standard isolation levels are:

1. **Read Uncommitted**:

   - Allows transactions to read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions.
   - **Use Case**: Useful in scenarios where performance is prioritized over data consistency.
   - **Drawback**: Can lead to dirty reads, meaning a transaction might read uncommitted changes that may later be rolled back.

   **Example**: A user might see a product price that a seller has updated but not finalized, leading to confusion.

2. **Read Committed**:

   - Only allows transactions to read data that has been committed. This level prevents dirty reads.
   - **Use Case**: Common in many applications where some level of consistency is needed.
   - **Drawback**: Non-repeatable reads can occur, where a value read once may change before the transaction is completed.

   **Example**: A user sees a product price, but if another transaction commits a change before the first transaction completes, the user could see a different price upon a subsequent read.

3. **Repeatable Read**:

   - Guarantees that if a transaction reads a value, it will see the same value on subsequent reads, even if other transactions are updating the data.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications where transactions must remain consistent during their execution.
   - **Drawback**: Phantom reads can occur, where new rows added by another transaction can be seen in subsequent queries.

   **Example**: In a bank system, if a user checks their balance, they will see the same balance throughout their transaction even if other transactions are occurring.

4. **Serializable**:

   - The strictest isolation level, ensuring complete isolation from other transactions. Transactions are executed in a way that the end result is as if they were executed one after the other.
   - **Use Case**: Required in highly critical applications where data integrity is paramount.
   - **Drawback**: Significant performance overhead and reduced concurrency due to potential locking of rows.

   **Example**: In a ticket booking system, if two users try to book the last ticket simultaneously, one transaction must wait for the other to finish to maintain data integrity.

---

### 26. Deadlock Handling

**Deadlocks** occur when two or more transactions wait indefinitely for each other to release locks.

#### Strategies to Prevent and Resolve Deadlocks:

1. **Deadlock Prevention**:

   - **Lock Ordering**: Establish a global order in which locks must be acquired.
   - **Timeouts**: Set timeouts on transactions so they automatically rollback if they wait too long for locks.
   - **Resource Allocation**: Limit the number of locks a transaction can hold at one time.

2. **Deadlock Detection and Resolution**:
   - Most databases have mechanisms to detect deadlocks. When a deadlock is detected, one of the transactions is rolled back to allow others to proceed.
   - **Example**: If Transaction A holds a lock on Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2, while Transaction B holds a lock on Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1, the system can choose to rollback Transaction A or B.

---

### 27. Concurrency Control

Concurrency control ensures that database transactions are executed concurrently without compromising the integrity of the database.

1. **Optimistic Locking**:

   - Assumes that transactions do not conflict. A transaction reads data, performs operations, and before committing, checks if the data has changed.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for environments with low contention.
   - **Example**: A user retrieves an order for editing. Before saving changes, the application checks if the order has been modified since retrieval.

2. **Pessimistic Locking**:
   - Assumes that conflicts will occur, so it locks the data at the beginning of a transaction until it's completed.
   - **Use Case**: Useful in high-contention environments where conflicts are frequent.
   - **Example**: In a banking application, when a user views an account balance, the application locks the account data until the transaction is completed to prevent other transactions from interfering.

---

### 28. Database Security

Database security is essential to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and breaches.

#### Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
  - **Methods**: Username/password, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), OAuth.
- **Authorization**: The process of granting or denying access to resources based on user roles.
  - **Roles and Permissions**:
    - **Roles**: Define a set of permissions, such as admin, user, or read-only.
    - **Example**: An admin role can create and delete records, while a user role can only read records.
- **Privileges**: Specific rights granted to users or roles to perform actions on the database.
  - **Example**: Granting SELECT privileges on certain tables to a reporting role.

---

#### Encryption

**Encryption** protects data by converting it into a secure format that is unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.

- **At Rest**: Encrypting data stored on disk.
  - **Example**: Using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to encrypt sensitive customer information in a database.
- **In Transit**: Encrypting data being transmitted over networks.
  - **Example**: Using SSL/TLS to secure communication between a web application and its database.

---

#### SQL Injection

**SQL Injection** is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.

##### Prevention and Mitigation:

1. **Parameterized Queries**: Use prepared statements to ensure that user input is treated as data, not executable code.

   - **Example**: Instead of directly embedding user inputs in SQL queries, use parameterized queries like:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?
     ```

2. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user inputs to ensure they meet expected formats.

   - **Example**: Allow only alphanumeric characters for usernames.

3. **Stored Procedures**: Use stored procedures to define and encapsulate SQL statements, reducing the chance of injection.
   - **Example**: A stored procedure that retrieves user data based on provided parameters.

---

#### Data Masking

**Data Masking** protects sensitive information by replacing it with anonymized or obfuscated values.

- **Purpose**: Ensures that sensitive data is not exposed in non-secure environments, such as development or testing.
- **Types**:
  - **Static Data Masking**: Modifies data in non-production environments while keeping original data intact.
  - **Dynamic Data Masking**: Transforms data on-the-fly as it is queried, presenting masked data to unauthorized users.
- **Example**: Masking credit card numbers in a customer database by displaying only the last four digits (e.g., `****-****-****-1234`).

---

### Summary

Understanding transactions and isolation levels, deadlock handling, concurrency control, and key database security measures are crucial for ensuring data integrity, performance, and protection against unauthorized access. Familiarize yourself with these concepts, their implications, and practical applications to effectively demonstrate your knowledge during interviews.

### 29. Backup and Recovery

**Backup and recovery** are critical components of database management that ensure data integrity and availability in case of failures, corruption, or disasters.

#### Backup Types

1. **Full Backup**:

   - A complete copy of the entire database at a specific point in time.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for initial backups and periodic complete copies of databases.
   - **Example**: Weekly full backups of a production database ensure all data is available for recovery.

2. **Differential Backup**:

   - A backup of all changes made since the last full backup.
   - **Use Case**: Reduces backup time and storage space compared to full backups while allowing for faster recovery.
   - **Example**: A differential backup taken daily captures changes made since the last full backup, enabling a quicker restore process.

3. **Incremental Backup**:
   - A backup of all changes made since the last backup (full or incremental).
   - **Use Case**: Minimizes storage space and reduces backup time significantly.
   - **Example**: After a full backup, incremental backups taken every few hours only store new changes, allowing for efficient storage.

---

#### Point-in-Time Recovery

**Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)** allows the restoration of a database to a specific moment, minimizing data loss.

- **How It Works**: The process typically involves using transaction logs to roll forward changes to a specific time.
- **Use Case**: Essential for recovering from user errors, such as accidental deletions or data corruption.

### 30. NoSQL Databases (Optional)

**NoSQL databases** are non-relational databases designed to handle a wide variety of data models, offering scalability and flexibility.

#### Types of NoSQL Databases

1. **Key-Value Stores**:

   - Data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs, allowing for fast retrieval.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for caching and session management.
   - **Example**: Redis and Amazon DynamoDB are popular key-value stores.

2. **Document Stores**:

   - Data is stored in documents (often JSON or XML), allowing for hierarchical structures and complex data types.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for content management systems and applications with varying data structures.
   - **Example**: MongoDB and Couchbase are widely used document databases.

3. **Columnar Databases**:

   - Data is stored in columns rather than rows, making them efficient for analytical queries.
   - **Use Case**: Best for data warehousing and analytics.
   - **Example**: Apache Cassandra and Google Bigtable are examples of columnar databases.

4. **Graph Databases**:
   - Data is represented as nodes and edges, allowing for complex relationships and queries.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.
   - **Example**: Neo4j and Amazon Neptune are popular graph databases.

#### Consistency Models

Consistency models define how data is viewed in distributed systems:

1. **Eventual Consistency**:

   - Guarantees that, eventually, all updates will propagate through the system and all nodes will converge to the same value.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for systems where high availability is prioritized over immediate consistency.
   - **Example**: Social media platforms may use eventual consistency to allow users to post updates quickly, ensuring all users see the same data eventually.

2. **Strong Consistency**:
   - Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, all subsequent reads will reflect that transaction's changes immediately.
   - **Use Case**: Necessary for applications that require immediate data accuracy.
   - **Example**: Banking applications must use strong consistency to ensure that account balances reflect the most recent transactions.

#### CAP Theorem

The **CAP Theorem** states that in a distributed data store, you can only achieve two out of the following three guarantees at the same time:

1. **Consistency**: All nodes return the same data at the same time.
2. **Availability**: Every request receives a response, whether successful or failed.
3. **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions.

- **Trade-offs**:
  - **CA (Consistency + Availability)**: Possible only when the system can tolerate no partition failures, suitable for a single data center.
  - **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**: Ensures consistency during partitions, but availability may be compromised.
  - **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**: Prioritizes availability, accepting potential inconsistencies during network failures.

#### Use Cases: When to Choose NoSQL over SQL

1. **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, making them suitable for applications with large volumes of data and high traffic.

   - **Example**: A video streaming service like Netflix can scale by adding more nodes to handle increased user demand.

2. **Flexible Schema**: When data models are likely to change frequently or are semi-structured, NoSQL databases offer flexibility.

   - **Example**: An e-commerce platform with rapidly changing product attributes can use a document store like MongoDB for flexible data structures.

3. **High Write/Read Throughput**: Applications that require high throughput with low latency benefit from NoSQL systems.

   - **Example**: Real-time analytics platforms or online gaming applications that handle thousands of transactions per second can leverage key-value stores for performance.

4. **Complex Relationships**: For applications that require complex relationships and graph-like queries, graph databases are ideal.
   - **Example**: Social networking applications benefit from graph databases to efficiently traverse user connections and relationships.

### Summary

Backup and recovery strategies are essential for maintaining data integrity and availability, while understanding NoSQL databases, their types, consistency models, and trade-offs provides insight into when to leverage non-relational solutions. Being well-versed in these topics will enhance your knowledge and readiness for interviews, helping you articulate the advantages and applications of both traditional SQL databases and modern NoSQL technologies.
